Just one more step until you're ready:

Create a file called 'header.txt' and put it in the directory that contains your source files.
Every line should be commented (e.g. prefixed with a hash '#')

Then, change directory to your project and run super_stamper:

 $ super_stamper

Enjoy stamping your own files!
