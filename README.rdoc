= super_stamper

* http://github.com/cmdjohnson/super_stamper

== DESCRIPTION:

Easily add a header (such as a copyright notice or license) recursively to multiple files in your project directory.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

This program removes any magic encoding lines such as these:

# -*- encoding : utf-8 -*-

After running super_stamper, you might want to run magic_encoding again.

If you use Rails, any plugin files (for example, in the vendor dir) will also be stamped.

== SYNOPSIS:

1. Create a file called 'header.txt' in your project dir
2. Run 'super_stamper'
3. Enjoy your freshly stamped files and impress yourself with a super-long 'git status' overview.

== REQUIREMENTS:

Ruby

== INSTALL:

 $ sudo gem install super_stamper
